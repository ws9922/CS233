Our team's strategy is to let our spimbots choose a random angel to turn when they bonk. At first, we only provided 4 random directions for Spimbots to choose, which led spambots to stick into corners. After optimization, we provide 12 random directions, which increased the flexibility of Spimbots. 
Our team's main goal focuses on the collection of kernels by maipnbots while ignoring the minibots and puzzles, which increases the efficiency of collection at the largest.
